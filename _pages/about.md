Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research is focused primarily on American Politics, Public Policy, and Political Behavior. I earned my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics and Political Science from the University of Notre Dame.

My research focuses on how major policies of the late twentieth-century, such as the push for local governments to outsource social services to non-profit organizations, have restructured local political economies. My dissertation, *The Policy Influence of Non-Profit Service Providers in Local Politics*, examines the causes of non-profit political activity and policy influence in local and state politics. Using over one hundred qualitaitve interviews, participant observation, archival research, and large-N observational analyses, I argue that the concentration of specialized expertise, non-profit embeddedness in policy networks, and interorganizational non-profit coordination empower non-profits to engage in political activity and policy influence. Further, I argue that because outsourcing institutes the partnerships and markets that give rise to these three key factors, the policy undermines its own goals by entrenching monopolistic, rent-seeking interest goals while also undermining the independence of civil society. In addition to this book project, I have published work and working papers on public opinion, political behavior, and policy feedback in the U.S. context.
