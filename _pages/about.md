Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research is focused mostly on American Politics, Public Policy, and Political Behavior. I earned my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics and Political Science from the University of Notre Dame.

My dissertation is about the causes and consequences of local and state governments in the United States outsourcing services to private non-profit organizations. I argue that outsourcing, which is a form of privatization, shapes how non-profit service providers participate in the political process and constrains government officials when trying to address important issues of public policy. I use a multi-method approach to answering these research questions, including experimental survey methods and qualitative case studies. I am also interested in questions of political behavior, including the structure of voters' political preferences and interventions to persuade.
